<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm David Williams and this is my area of the Internet.</h1>
	<p>I'm an IT Architect at Shell Oil where I focus on Microsoft Azure and middleware services such as Microsoft Biztalk and Microsoft SSIS.
	I also spend a lot of my freetime playing around with technology so I figured I would create an area of the Internet to share some of things
	I think are worth sharing.</p>
